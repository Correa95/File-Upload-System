<!-- Data serialization -->

serializers.py file: which is required to go from a Python object to JSON. Here we define what attributes we want to be displayed in the JSON.

## What are Migrations

Migrations describe your database structure and changes made to the structure over time. These migrations can then be **applied** to generate the needed database.

# SQL

stands for structured query language and is a standard language for working with structured databases.

## ORM

An **object relational mapper** allows you to describe your tables using classes in your primary language, not SQL. Instead of working with table rows you will work with objects (instances of a class).

The ORM creates a mapping between objects in code and rows in the database table. Instead of working with SQL directly you can work with a list of objects.

A model is a Python class that defines the structure of our data. We will then be able to create a migration based on this data structure and automatically create the appropriate tables.

# Reset PostgreSQL Password

If you suspect the password is incorrect, you can reset it using:
Open PostgreSQL interactive shell:

psql -U postgres
If prompted for a password, enter the existing one. If you donâ€™t remember it, proceed to the next step.

# Reset the password inside PostgreSQL:

ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'newpassword';

A JSON web token is a long sequence of characters that encodes information about the logged in User as well as token lifetime (when the token expires).

# Command to get a new SECRET_KEY

py manage.py shell
from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
print(get_random_secret_key())
